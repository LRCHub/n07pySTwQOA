Where is all began
Born on desert sands
Desperate citizens
Led by scorpions
Now the condition
Religious discipline
Foraging fanaticism
Heaven this mouth of soap
God his private joke

So save me

This camel in the needles eye
Will laugh and let you die
Tear from limb to limb
Take this pound of flesh
Searing chinking dust
Madness full of lust
Tear from limb to limb
Take this pound of flesh

Save me
Save me

Faith in foolish words
Cows now join the heard
A mass of mindless ants
Dead as decadence
Grind this golend crock
And bleat among the flock

Save me
Back,
Back to the country
Back to mother earth
Out near sellafield my nuclear birth

And Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me [repeat]
