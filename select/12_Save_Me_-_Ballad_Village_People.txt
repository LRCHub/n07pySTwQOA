Save me. Baby, save me.
I am drowning.
Come in after me.
Save me. Darling, save me.
Take my hand, help me to stand.

Save me. Baby, save me.
I am lonely, and I need someone.
Someone special.
Someone beautiful.
Oh, someone like you.
That's all I need.

Save me. Baby, save me.
I am hungry.
Feed me with your love.
Save me. Baby, save me.
Share with me this ecstasy.

Oh, if you only knew
What a feeling I have for you.
Oh, you're the love of my life
And only you can...

Save me. Baby, save me.
'Cause this heart
This heart is filled with love for you.
Love me. Please love me.
And if it's a dream, then it's
It's coming true.

Save me. Save me, save me, save me.
Feel this feeling that I have inside.
Won't you save me? Please save me.
And if there are fears, then why don't you push them,
Push them all aside?

Save me. Baby, save me.
I am lost at sea.
Won't you rescue me?
Save me. Baby, save me.
Tell me YES, I'll do the rest.

Save me. Baby, save me.
I am drowning. Come in after me.
Save me. Darling, save me.
Take my hand. Help me to stand.

Save me. Baby, save me.
I am lonely, and I need someone...
